# Pricing of Financial Options
This project is based on the course: "Computational Finance: Pricing and Valuation 1TD186 12010 HT2022" given by Uppsala University. The course is divided into five different assignments. In each assignment a different variation of either the finite difference scheme, or the Monte-Carlo method is used to price different types of financial options.

The project is divided into five folders containing an assignment each. Every folder contains the assignment description named: "Assignment{x}.pdf", a solution to the assignment named "Solution{x}.pdf" or "Solution{x}.mlx" (for MATLAB live scripts), aswell as all the helper functions used in the assignment. 

Assignment 1 *********************************

     Implementing a Monte-Carlo method using Euler's scheme to price an European call option, when the underlying stock follows a constant elasticity of 
     variance model (CEV model). 
  
  The experiment include: how the error converges with respect to discretization error and sample error, 
  implementing antithetic variates and how the option price and gamma are related.

Assignment 2 *********************************

  Implementing a (both explicit and implicit) finite difference method to price an European call option, when the underlying stock follows a 
  constant elasticity of variance model (CEV model). The experiment include: how the error converges with respect to spatial and time step, 
  stability analysis of the explicit and implicit finite difference method, analysis of the time complexity and how the option price and gamma are related.

Assignment 3 *********************************

  Compare the Monte-Carlo method with the finite difference method. The analysis include comparison of convergence, time complexity and computations 
  of the greeks (delta).
